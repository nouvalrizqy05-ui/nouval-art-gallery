# Nouval's Art Gallery

In this part of my portfolio, I aimed to recreate a virtual first-person experience of exploring an art gallery. To achieve this, I created first-person controls and integrated all my side projects as if they were part of the museum's exhibits.

You can now explore it [here](https://nouval-art-gallery.app/).
